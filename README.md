# A repository for the Hackathon at Semana Franco-Mexicana de IA

This Hackathon focus on mobility data from Ciudad de México (México) and Lyon (France). These two cities, as many other large cities in the world, have implemented a bike sharing system, for a few years now, and they share data about the system usage. This can give us great insights on mobility patterns within the cities!
